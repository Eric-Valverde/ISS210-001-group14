In order to put an end to the negative effects these stereotypes have on these students, we need to address the current problem marginalized students face, educate others on stereotyping and racism, and create an inclusive environment for every group/ethnicity. This will reduce the amount of stereotypes marginalized students face, allowing them to succeed in their academics and education.

                <div class="container"><p>Stereotypes: an often unfair and untrue belief that many people have about all people or things with a particular characteristic. Why care about stereotyping? After all, we make assumptions about almost everything in our lives: whether we can sleep in an extra ten minutes, what route to work will be the fastest, or how our friends will react to us canceling plans. So why when we put these assumptions on other people is it bad? We chose to investigate how stereotyping affects success and status within marginalized students because it is relevant to each of us and we want to answer these questions for the public. Being in college, we encounter different backgrounds daily and this is essential for our growth as members in society. This issue is also prevalent for many other students, not only in America but also other students around the world and the education system. The number one thing we can do as productive members of society is to educate and be educated about stereotypes. Doing this will help conquer the bigger problem of racism in our nation and the world. Overall having a more inclusive environment will benefit society by adding skills in education and workforce that might not be obtained with prejudice present. Working at REI has made me realize the importance of no prejudice by putting me in practice daily. REI’s mission is to get as many people into the outdoors as possible regardless of background. Having prejudgments about an individual could prevent a sale or discourage a valuable member of the outdoors. Towards the beginning of summer a customer came over to me wanting assistance with hiking boots. He was overweight and had a cart full of new stuff. I could assume that he was just getting into hiking. Instead of assessing his capability based on that, I gave him the same information I would give frequent shoppers. I recommended the things that I would use and what I thought would work best for him. He left that day and I didn’t think much of it. It was just another customer in my long shift. I didn’t realize the significance until he came back into the store at the end of the summer. He was much slimmer than at the start of the summer and he thanked me so much for helping him. He talked about how he had been discouraged from people in the past assessing his current ability instead of his goals. I enjoyed talking for about an hour with him about the multiple trips he took around the country. Overall stereotypes behave as a barrier for many people. Individuals shouldn’t have to deal with obstacles like stereotypes. It is important for proactive members of society to work against stereotypes, prejudice, and negative predispositions in their daily lives. Our annotations provide support for stereotyping in racial, social, and gender can affect success within marginalized students.</p>

For instance, if you can find a local organization to call/volunteer/donate/etc., you may want to put their information in one of these containers. Likewise, your image may be a phone. The title of this image may be their organization. In the space where this is all typed, you will talk about them. If they are an organization, you may include their mission statement or their spokesperson or representative image. If it is literature, be sure to include significant evidence here.

                                    <p class="mb-4">In the nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Europe, tens of thousands of women (majority being English, German and French, although there were also Swiss, Belgians, Italians, Spaniards and other nationalities) left home for neighboring countries, or further afield in Europe, in hopes of personal fulfillment/financial rewards through education. Under these pressing influences, nations became image-conscious and fashioning identities based on characteristics that defined foreign women of their singularity that clearly distinguished them from others: their language, race, religion, culture, and history. These stereotyping made one become identified by their nationality rather than personality, thus labeling lent itself to facile and facetious judgements. This negatively affected the thinking, actions, and reactions of individual women, hindering the establishment of an amicable working relationship with peers, as well as depersonalizing and dehumanizing the individual. To reduce the stereotypes foreign women face, European schools need to educate students on a foreign nation’s real history in order to dismiss the stereotypes formed from its perceived defects and misdeeds. Schools also need to include media that contain various foreign cultures and perspectives in their curriculum, allowing students to be exposed to the world of diversity, thus getting them to expand their thinking and acceptance. Students can personally overcome their biases by interacting with the foreign students and learning about the actual individual, rather than their national character. This will combat racism and create an educational environment where every individual regardless of ethnic background is equal.</p>
