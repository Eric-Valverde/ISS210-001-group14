In order to put an end to the negative effects these stereotypes have on these students, we need to address the current problem marginalized students face, educate others on stereotyping and racism, and create an inclusive environment for every group/ethnicity. This will reduce the amount of stereotypes marginalized students face, allowing them to succeed in their academics and education.

                <div class="container"><p>Stereotypes: an often unfair and untrue belief that many people have about all people or things with a particular characteristic. Why care about stereotyping? After all, we make assumptions about almost everything in our lives: whether we can sleep in an extra ten minutes, what route to work will be the fastest, or how our friends will react to us canceling plans. So why when we put these assumptions on other people is it bad? We chose to investigate how stereotyping affects success and status within marginalized students because it is relevant to each of us and we want to answer these questions for the public. Being in college, we encounter different backgrounds daily and this is essential for our growth as members in society. This issue is also prevalent for many other students, not only in America but also other students around the world and the education system. The number one thing we can do as productive members of society is to educate and be educated about stereotypes. Doing this will help conquer the bigger problem of racism in our nation and the world. Overall having a more inclusive environment will benefit society by adding skills in education and workforce that might not be obtained with prejudice present. Working at REI has made me realize the importance of no prejudice by putting me in practice daily. REI’s mission is to get as many people into the outdoors as possible regardless of background. Having prejudgments about an individual could prevent a sale or discourage a valuable member of the outdoors. Towards the beginning of summer a customer came over to me wanting assistance with hiking boots. He was overweight and had a cart full of new stuff. I could assume that he was just getting into hiking. Instead of assessing his capability based on that, I gave him the same information I would give frequent shoppers. I recommended the things that I would use and what I thought would work best for him. He left that day and I didn’t think much of it. It was just another customer in my long shift. I didn’t realize the significance until he came back into the store at the end of the summer. He was much slimmer than at the start of the summer and he thanked me so much for helping him. He talked about how he had been discouraged from people in the past assessing his current ability instead of his goals. I enjoyed talking for about an hour with him about the multiple trips he took around the country. Overall stereotypes behave as a barrier for many people. Individuals shouldn’t have to deal with obstacles like stereotypes. It is important for proactive members of society to work against stereotypes, prejudice, and negative predispositions in their daily lives. Our annotations provide support for stereotyping in racial, social, and gender can affect success within marginalized students.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">Oftentimes teachers become over engrossed in the material they are teaching. When you do their job as long and often as they have, it can be hard to be a shining role model for your students, especially if you are solely focused on the paycheck. Teachers sometimes let their own prejudices and experiences get in the way of their teaching, which leads to bad habits in their students. Teachers should not just be watchful for this, but any adult that serves to help moderate the students life. This image serves to remind teachers and non-teachers that the role of schools in our society is education, not indoctrination. Students should be brought up and taught in a place that encourages learning and growth rather than stagnation and moral questionability. </p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">Stereotypes can negatively impact one’s self esteem. A study was done where two groups of students were given information about their social class. When one group learned that they were considered a lower income group, they automatically associated themselves with being “dumber” than the rest. The stereotype that your family background ties in to how intelligent you are weighed in on how they felt about themselves as students. When students believe that they cannot do well in class due to the fact that they are not as smart as the rest, it starts to affect how hard they try in class. Ultimately, this behavior can result in them attaining poor grades in school and not achieving success in the future. However, this issue is psychological. When the study was performed without the mention of social class to students, the students were more likely to assume that they would perform better in school.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4"><br>This photo portrays a classroom filled with African American students. The PDF talks about how African American students are stereotyped and discriminated against in class. They receive lots of bias for behavior which is normal for children. This discrimination comes from society’s “white normative”. When a teacher possesses a bias toward African American children there is an unequal discipline. The negative perceptions and stereotypes of African American students affect their academic experience. According to the article, African American students are suspended at higher rates compared to white children. Teachers assume due to the negative perceptions on black women they need more correction and need more supervision compared to white girls. This is a problem that needs to be changed.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">In the nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Europe, tens of thousands of women (majority being English, German and French, although there were also Swiss, Belgians, Italians, Spaniards and other nationalities) left home for neighboring countries, or further afield in Europe, in hopes of personal fulfillment/financial rewards through education. Under these pressing influences, nations became image-conscious and fashioning identities based on characteristics that defined foreign women of their singularity that clearly distinguished them from others: their language, race, religion, culture, and history. These stereotyping made one become identified by their nationality rather than personality, thus labeling lent itself to facile and facetious judgements. This negatively affected the thinking, actions, and reactions of individual women, hindering the establishment of an amicable working relationship with peers, as well as depersonalizing and dehumanizing the individual. To reduce the stereotypes foreign women face, European schools need to educate students on a foreign nation’s real history in order to dismiss the stereotypes formed from its perceived defects and misdeeds. Schools also need to include media that contain various foreign cultures and perspectives in their curriculum, allowing students to be exposed to the world of diversity, thus getting them to expand their thinking and acceptance. Students can personally overcome their biases by interacting with the foreign students and learning about the actual individual, rather than their national character. This will combat racism and create an educational environment where every individual regardless of ethnic background is equal.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">The image depicts stereotypes between different genders. It shows two people speaking their mind and how they have different ideas and perceptions of things. The image shows how their preconceived notions for what they want to/able to do can limit themselves from reaching their full potential and can also create barriers to success because it reinforces the stereotype of how men and women are supposed to think a certain way or are only able to complete certain tasks based on their gender. For example, the speech bubble for the man includes video games, fishing, and tools, while the speech bubble for the woman contains jewelry, art, and love. These stereotypes can create a self-fulfilling prophecy, where individuals may not even try to succeed in a certain area because they believe they are not supposed to even partake in the activity or ideology based on their gender. This also includes career paths or goals that students may have in mind but can’t reach based on stereotypes enforced by others. For example, it is more common for a woman to not pursue a career in a male-dominated field like engineering or construction since she believes that it is not her "place" to do so because it has been enforced by schools to make the students think that they can only pursue certain careers. Similarly, a man may not take on certain careers that are female-dominated like nursing or teaching because they have generally seen only women in these fields. In order to break these stereotypes it is important to challenge and overcome these stereotypes to create a more inclusive and fair society where people can succeed based on their abilities and not be limited to these gender stereotypes.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">The Rorschach Inkblot test is one of the most famously used psychological tests in any media. It is displayed in movies, used in real psychology, and used in artistic expression, as it is used above. Typically, the inkblots will reveal a blurry picture, one that you would have to turn your head and squint at to see anything intelligible. In this image, however, the picture in the ink is clear: mirror images of a student being pointed at disdainfully. This artistic rendition of the famous test points out the constant battle students face in the classroom against the scornful finger of stereotyping. Students of all kinds are fighting hard every day to prove that they can excel in the classroom on many levels. They work to get good grades, maintain physical activity, and develop a close social circle. With these tools, they will not only push through barriers in an educational setting, but in general life as well. </p>
